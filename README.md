# fprime-fft-benchmark
Benchmark of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with FÂ´

This project aims at providing a benchmark deployment of a software system running FFTs and developed with F'.

Thanks to F' and its OSAL (OS - Abstraction Layer), the benchmark can be deployed on multiple execution platforms (OS and hardware platform) in a relatively transparent way.
