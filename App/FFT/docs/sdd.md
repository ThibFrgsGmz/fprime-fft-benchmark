# FFT Component

## Introduction

`FFT` is a demonstration component that performs a two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a randomly generated image.

The implementation of the FFT algorithm is taken from the mathematical library `CCMATH` of Daniel A. Atkinson.

## Requirements

The requirements for FFT are as follows:

Requirement | Description | Verification Method
----------- | ----------- | -------------------
REQ-FFT-001 | The `FFT` component shall reply to ping requests. | System test
REQ-FFT-002 | The `FFT` component shall provide a command to enable/disable its execution. | System test
REQ-FFT-003 | The `FFT` component must provide a command to set the dimension of the FFT algorithm. | System test
